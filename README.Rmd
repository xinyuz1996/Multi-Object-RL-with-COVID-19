* Main packages for the proposed estimation procedure
    - abind
    - crayon
    - doFuture
    - doParallel
    - foreach
    - ggplot2
    - ggpubr
    - grid
    - gridExtra
  	- matrixStats
  	- parallel
  	- plyr
  	- randomForest
  	

* Additional packages for experiments
    - gtools
    - dplyr

## File Overview
1. Files in the main folder: scripts for reproducing results. 

  * `4_2_sir_pred.R`: script to conduct estimation and validation of the transition model in Section 4.2.
  * `4_3_pareto_eval.R`: script to conduct evaluation of the Pareto optimal policies in Section 4.3 and Figure in C.3.
  * `C_2_simu_valid.R`: script to conduct cross validation in Section C.2.
  
  
2. Files in the `/code` folder
    1. the proposed method
        * `SIR.R`: main functions for the generalized dynamics model
        * `RL.R`: main functions for the reinforcement learning algorithms
        * `utility.R`: helper functions for SIR model and RL parts
    2. experiments
        * `simu.R`: main functions for simulation experiments
        * `simu_utility.R`: helper functions for simulation experiments

## Reproduce Results

To reproduce ourexperiment results in the paper, change the working directory to the main folder which includs this README file, modify the `main_path` in the script, run commands below, and read the corresponding outputs from `/output`. 

###  Preview data described in Section 4.1

```{r}
data = readRDS("./data.rds")
names(data)
str(data$Beijing)
```




###  Generate results in Section 4.2
Run `4.2_sir_pred.R` to get the following results:

  1. Figure 2 (./output/Figure2.png) 
  2. Table 1 (./output/Table1.txt)
  3. Fitted cost in Section C1 in the supplementary (./output/Cost_in_C1.txt)


```{r}
cat(readLines("./output/Table1.txt"), sep = '\n')
```


```{r label, fig.cap = "Figure2: Validation results for the six important cities in China."}
knitr::include_graphics("./output/Figure2.png")
```




###  Generate result in Section 4.3
Run `4.3_pareto_eval.R` to get Figure 3 (./output/Figure3.png) 

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3: Cumulative epidemiological costs and economic costs following different policies, averaged over 100 replications. The closer to the left bottom corner, the better."}
knitr::include_graphics("./output/Figure3.png")
```
 

###  Generate result in Section C.1 in supplementary
```{r}
cat(readLines("./output/Cost_in_C1.txt"), sep = '\n')
```

###  Generate result in Section C.2 in supplementary
  
```{r}
average_error_ratio = readRDS("./output/C2_err.rds");average_error_ratio
```  
    
###  Generate result in Section C.3 in supplementary
Run `4.3_pareto_eval.R` to get Figure 1 in supplementary (./output/Figure1_supp.png)
 
```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1 in supplementary: Cumulative epidemiological cost and economic cost following different policies, averaged over 100 replications. The closer to the left bottom corner, the better. With the shaded areas indicating the 95% confidence regions."}
knitr::include_graphics("./output/Figure1_supp.png")
```
